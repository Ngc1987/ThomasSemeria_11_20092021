## 3. Project
This project is the 11th project for the React front-end developer [formation](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react#main_content) of OpenClassRooms.
We have to build an App who display some apartments for the user, who can choose one to rent for holidays, business travels... There is one home page who displays all apartments, one page for each apartment, one page "à propos" who tells some informations of the enterprise, and one error page who is displayed when the url is incorrect.
It's the first project of the formation where we use React, with `create-react-app`. I make my first components based on classes, it was one of the instructions of the project.

For this project i use:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router Dom](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- [NodeJS (**version 12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.


### 3.2 Launching the project

- Fork this repository
- Clone it on your computer.
- Open the terminal and write `cd kasa`
- Then write on the terminal `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- You can now do an `npm start` and the App is now hosted on http://localhost:3000
















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
